# pong-macroquad-hecs

A BLAZINGLY FAST Pong clone implemented in Rust using the Macroquad and hecs libraries.

### Controls:
* SPACE (while in PauseState or PlayerScoredState) : Play/Continue
* W, S : Control Player1 movements
* UP, DOWN : Control Player2 movements
* ESC (while in GameState) : Pause game
* R (while in PlayerScoredState) : Reset game

Note : This is my first ever game written in Rust. I found the transition from Raylib/C++ to Rust/Macroquad to be very smooth, and quite fun. Would 100% recommend!
Feel free to judge/leave suggestions on improvement :)
